## Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a 32-bit single-cycle processor in Logisim, based on a custom 24-bit instruction set architecture (ISA).  
The processor integrates all major hardware components — the register file, ALU, control unit, PC controller, and datapath — into a unified system capable of executing arithmetic, logic, memory, and branching operations.

The processor supports three main instruction formats:
- R-Type – Register operations (e.g., ADD, AND, SLT)  
- I-Type – Immediate operations and branching (e.g., ADDI, BEQ, LW, SW)  
- J-Type – Jump operations (e.g., J, JAL)

## Processor Components
### 1. Register File
- Contains 16 general-purpose 32-bit registers (R0–R15).  
- R0 is hardwired to zero.  
- Includes one write port (Rx) and two read ports (Ry, Rz) controlled by decoders.  

### 2. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Supports 12 operations including: AND, CAND, OR, XOR, ADD, NADD, SEQ, SLT, SLL, SRL, SRA, and ROR.  
- Built using a 16x1 multiplexer and 32-bit logic circuits.  

### 3. Control Unit
- Decodes instruction opcodes and generates control signals for datapath components.  
- Handles signals like RegDst, RegWrite, MemWrite, ALUsel, and WbData.  

### 4. PC Controller
- Determines program counter updates based on instruction type:  
  - PC += 3 for normal execution  
  - PC += (Imm8 << 1) for branches  
  - PC += (Imm16 << 1) for jumps  

### 5. Datapath
- Integrates all modules for instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory, and write-back cycles.  
- Includes RAM, ROM, RegSel, and control multiplexers to manage instruction flow.

## Simulation and Testing
Each instruction was tested in Logisim using waveform analysis to confirm proper behavior.  
Key tested instructions include:

| Type | Example | Function |
|------|----------|-----------|
| R-Type | ADD R5, R1, R2 | Adds two registers |
| I-Type | ADDI R8, R1, 3 | Adds register and immediate |
| Branch | BEQ R1, R2, 2 | Branches if equal |
| Memory | LW R6, R0, 4 / SW R1, R0, 4 | Load/store |
| Jump | J 2, JAL 2 | Jump and link |

All instructions produced correct results across multiple test programs.  
Simulation verified correct data movement, PC updates, control signals, and branch execution.

## Results
- The processor successfully executed all R-type, I-type, and J-type instructions.  
- Control logic and datapath synchronization were validated through simulation.  
- The done flag, branch decisions, and PC behavior were consistent with expectations.  
- The final design demonstrates proper integration between all hardware components.
